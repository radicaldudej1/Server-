    <h1>About</h1>

    <h2>I like quotes</h2>
        <p>
          <li>"Be who you are and say what you feel, because those who mind don't matter, and those who matter don't mind.”</li> <br>
          <li>"Imperfection is beauty, madness is genius and it's better to be absolutely ridiculous than absolutely boring.”</li><br>
          <li>“Be yourself; everyone else is already taken.”</li><br>
        </p>

    <h2>Like a lot</h2>
        <p>
          Love myself I do. Not everything, but I love the good as well as the bad. I love my crazy lifestyle, and I love my hard discipline. I love my freedom of speech and the way my eyes get dark when I'm tired. I love that I have learned to trust people with my heart, even if it will get broken. I am proud of everything that I am and will become.
        </p>

    <h2>I have a problem</h2>
        <p>
          I would rather go through life sober, believing I am an alcoholic, than go through life drunk, trying to convince myself that I am not.
